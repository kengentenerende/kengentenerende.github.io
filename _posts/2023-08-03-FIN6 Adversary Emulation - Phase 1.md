## What is Kali Purple?

Kali Linux, the popular Debian-based Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing, announced a new project named [**Kali Purple**](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/kali-purple/documentation/-/wikis/home), a distro designed for defensive security.

On a high level, Kali Purple consists of:

Over 100 defensive tools, such as:

- Arkime full packet capture
- Cyberchef
- Elasticsearch SIEM
- GVM vulnerability scanner
- TheHive incident response platform
- Malcolm
- Suricata IDS
- Zeek IDS
- and of course all the usual Kali tools


ISOs:

- Kali Purple
- Malcolm - based on Kali
- Hedgehog - based on Kali


A defensive menu structure according to NIST CSF:

- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover

## Setting-up Elastic Stack

In this article, Iâ€™ll walk you through the deployment of Elasticsearch SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) with Kibana on Kali Purple.

<https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/kali-purple/documentation/-/blob/main/301_kali-purple/installation.txt>


## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/elastic-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
sudo bash -c "export HOSTNAME=kali-purple.kali.purple; apt-get install elasticsearch -y"
```

The default username is _elastic_. Additionally, ensure that you save the password, which can be found under _Security AutoConfiguration Information_.

## 2. Convert to Single-Node Setup

```bash
sudo sed -e '/cluster.initial_master_nodes/ s/^#*/#/' -i /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
echo "discovery.type: single-node" | sudo tee -a /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
```

## 3. Install Kibana

```bash
sudo apt install kibana
sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-encryption-keys generate -q
```

Add keys to <kbd>/etc/kibana/kibana.yml</kbd>

```bash
echo "server.host: \"kali-purple.kali.purple\"" | sudo tee -a /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
```

Ensure that kali-purple.kali.purple is only mapped to the IP address of your Kali Purple Machine in <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> in order to bind the Kibana interface.

Once done, you can now start Elasticsearch and Kibana.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch kibana --now
```

## 4. Enroll Kibana

To generate an Enrollment Token for Kibana, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
```

Next, open a web browser and navigate to the following address:
- http://{_internal_ip_from_step_3_}:5601

You will be redirected to the enrollment page of Kibana. At this point, paste the previously generated token.

After that, you will be prompted to enter the Verification Code into Kibana.

To generate Verification Code for Kibana, execute the following command:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-verification-code
```

Then, enter the default username _elastic_ along with the password generated in Step 1. Now, you can access Elasticsearch SIEM on Kali Purple.
